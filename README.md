# Technologies Used: 

To build this I used NodeJS, CSS, HTML, REACT & JavaScript 

I first built the backend using NodeJS, MongoDB, Mongoose and Express. This allowed me to create my CRUD funtionality for my frontend, 
which was tested using postman. 

I then moved to the frontend where I used a combination of HTML, CSS, REACT and JS to built the sites structure. I used multiple componnents and pages. 
Seperating out the redundant tasks into components allowed for a cleaner and DRYer code. 

Once that was complete I begin to work on stretch features. This included, Auth and a counter for a make shift shopping cart just to show functionality. 
The Auth was rather dificult to implament. It requried a complete reworking of the routes along with conditionales for allowing users to create and delete images. 
This was all done in a little over five days.

# Next Steps:

When I have more time I would like to get a fully funtioning cart added. I would also like to add in the ability to upload images. 
There is also alot more css that needs to be done. I would also like to have user pages for each account. That way you could find more images from that one user
